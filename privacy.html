        <p>
            Picanik (“we”, “us”, or “our”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains
            what information we collect, how we use it, and your choices regarding that information.

            <li><strong>Optional notes</strong> — information you choose to share with us</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            We do not require account creation at this stage and do not collect payment information.
        </p>

        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>

        </ul>

        <p>
            We do not sell your personal information and do not use it for unrelated marketing.
        </p>

        <h2>Analytics</h2>

        <p>
            We may use basic analytics tools to understand general site usage
            (such as page visits or referral sources). These tools do not identify you personally.
        </p>

        <h2>Discord and External Links</h2>

        <p>
            Our site includes links to external services such as Discord.
            Interactions with those services are governed by their own privacy policies.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>

        <p>
            We take reasonable measures to protect the information you provide.
            However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure.
